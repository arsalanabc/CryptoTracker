CryptoTracker
===========

CryptoTracker is an Application to track the growth of your coin's assets over
time. Currency exchanges get very complicated, very quickly. A purchase of one
coin on one day will have a different value than that coin exchanged week's
later for another coin. So, this tracker will allow you to indicate currencies
that have been exchanged (USD -> XBT, XBT -> DOGE, etc.). Then, it will use the
growth of those currencies over time to determine the present value of your coin
assets. It will also report the present-day cost of your original investments
allowing you to determine just how much your portfolio has grown/shrunk.

At some point this application will include a save/recall feature that allows
you to store your profile. Another feature would be the use of blockchain
addresses to query transactions automatically.
